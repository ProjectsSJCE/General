offset = (int)(NUMclient / num_threads);
create threads( num_threads in number)
end = 0;
for (iter=0; iter<num_threads; iter++)
{
    start = end;
    end += offset;
    if( iter == (num_threads-1))
        end = NUMclient;
    thread[i].start(function, arguments(which include start and end);
}

wait for all threads to finish.

now start with next function use above code.
